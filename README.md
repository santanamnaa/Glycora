# Glycora

**Glycora** is an AI-powered diabetes prediction app that utilizes personal health data to predict the risk of diabetes. The app is built using **Streamlit** and **machine learning models** to provide real-time predictions and explore diabetes data.

## Features

- **Prediction Page**: Enter personal data to receive a diabetes risk prediction.
- **Explore Page**: Visualize and analyze diabetes data, including a confusion matrix for model performance.
